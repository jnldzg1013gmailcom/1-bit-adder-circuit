## How it works

Changing values of the three inputs gives you different outputs.

## How to test

1. Try all combinations of inputs(A, B, and C-in)
2. Observe the results with the LEDs for SUM and C-out
3. Make sure that results match expected results for binary addition

## External hardware

2 LEDs, 3 buttons, and 3 truth gate chips
